This repository contains source code for redfish_client gem that can be used
to connect to Redfish services.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "redfish_client"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redfish_client


## Usage

Minimal program that uses this gem would look something like this:

    require "redfish_client"

    root = RedfishClient.new("https://localhost:8000",
                             prefix: "/redfish/v1",
                             verify: false)
    puts root
    root.login("username", "password")
    puts root.Systems
    root.logout


## Handling asynchronous operations

Redfish service can return a 202 status when we request an execution of a
long-running operation (e.g. updating firmware). We are expected to poll the
monitor for changes until the job terminates.

Responses in Redfish client have a built-in support for this, so polling the
service is rather painless:

    # Start the async action
    response = update_service.Actions["#UpdateService.SimpleUpdate"].post(
      field: "target", payload: { ... },
    )
    # Wait for the termination
    response = update_service.wait(response)
    # Do something with response

It is also possible to manually poll the response like this:

    response = update_service.Actions["#UpdateService.SimpleUpdate"].post(
      field: "target", payload: { ... },
    )
    until response.done?
      # wait a bit
      response = update_service.get(response.monitor)
    end

Response is also safe to (de)serialize, which means that the process that
started the async operation and the process that will wait for it can be
separate:

    response = update_service.Actions["#UpdateService.SimpleUpdate"].post(
      field: "target", payload: { ... },
    )
    send_response_somewhere(response.to_h)

    # Somewhere else
    response = Response.from_hash(receive_response_from_somewhere)


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then,
run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To create new release, increment the version number, commit the change, tag
the commit and push tag to the GitHub. Travis CI will pick from there on and
create new release, publishing it on https://rubygems.org.
